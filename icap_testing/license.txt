5.   Customer Responsibilities.
       5.1   Customer acknowledges that the Software and/or Services are subject to export control laws in the United States, the United Kingdom (UK) and elsewhere.  Customer shall comply with all applicable export laws, obtain all applicable export licenses and will not export or re-export any part of the Software to any country in violation of such restrictions. Customer acknowledges that the Product licensed pursuant to this Agreement may also be subject to export controls applicable to cybersecurity items under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations ("EAR").  Customer shall not use the Product, or allow the same to be used, to affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems, without authorization by the owner, operator, or administrator of the information system (including the information and processes within such systems).  Customer further represents and warrants that it will not export, reexport, or transfer (in country) the Product to be used to affect, without authorization, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems; nor does Customer know or have reason to know that the Product will be put to such use.
       5.2   Customer represents and warrants that it has not taken, and will not take, any action that would cause the other Party, and its subsidiaries or affiliates to violate any anti-corruption law, including but not limited to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and all other applicable anti-corruption laws.   
       5.3   Customer will maintain records reasonably required to verify its compliance with this Agreement.  Without limitation to the foregoing, Customer will purchase sufficient licenses for the number of Seats it will need at all times.  On Fortra's written request, not more frequently than annually, Fortra may audit Customer's use of the Software.  Any such audit shall be conducted during Customer's normal business hours and in such a manner as to avoid unreasonable interference with Customer's business operations. If an audit reveals that Customer has underpaid fees to Fortra, Customer shall be invoiced for such underpaid fees.
       5.4   Customer acknowledges that the Software is a "Commercial Item", as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. § 227.7202, as applicable.  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §§ 12.212, 227.7202-1 through 227,7202-4, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end-users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end-users pursuant to the terms and conditions in this Agreement.

Some of these features can be turned off by Customer in the administrator user interface.  The ability of technical support services to support Customer efficiently and in the best way will be impaired if Customer turns off any of these features.  Fortra does not collect any personal data as part of this sharing of information and will treat all information received in confidence.  If Customer is using the Software through a managed service or hosted service provided by Fortra, Customer accepts that its data, including personal data, may be held on servers and/or in environments that are owned and controlled by Fortra or third parties it contracts with to provide the service.  Fortra recognizes that Customer data is sensitive and will treat all such data as confidential when held in its controlled servers or environments all of which operate in accordance with Fortra's privacy policies.

6.   Software Ownership; Intellectual Property Indemnification.       
       6.1   Fortra shall have sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, Services, Software Documentation and all copies thereof including all derivations, modifications and enhancements thereto (including but not limited to ownership of all intellectual property rights).  The applicable vendor of Third-Party software shall have sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in such Third-Party Software and all copies thereof including all derivations, modifications and enhancements thereto (including but not limited to ownership of all intellectual property rights). This Agreement does not provide Customer with title or ownership of the Software, Services and/or Software Documentation, Third-Party Software and Third-Party Software Documentation, but only a right of limited use.  
       6.2   Fortra shall defend at its own expense any action against Customer brought by a third party to the extent that the action is based upon a claim that the Software directly infringes a valid United States patent or copyright, and Fortra will  pay  those  costs  and  damages finally awarded  against  Customer  in  any  such  action  that  are  specifically attributable to such claim or those costs and damages agreed to in a monetary settlement of such action. Fortra's obligations under this Section 6.2 are conditioned on (a) Customer notifying Fortra within ten (10) days of notice of such action, (b) Customer giving Fortra sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations, and (c) Customer cooperating with Fortra in such defense (including, without limitation, by making available to Fortra all documents and materials in Customer's possession or control that are relevant to the infringement or misappropriation claims, and by making Customer's personnel available to testify or  consult with Fortra or  its attorneys in connection with said defense). If the Software becomes, or in Fortra's opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement or misappropriation claim, Fortra  may, at its option and expense, either (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing, or (iii) terminate Customer's right to use the Software and give Customer a refund or credit of the amounts actually paid by Customer to Fortra  for the Software less a reasonable allowance for the period of time Customer has used the Software.   Fortra will have no obligation with respect to any infringement or misappropriation claim based upon (1) any use of the Software not in accordance with the Agreement or for purposes not intended by Fortra; (2) any use of the Software in combination with other products, equipment, software, or data not supplied by Fortra; (3) any use of any release of the Software other than the most current release made available to Customer; or (4) any modification of the Software made by any Person other than Fortra. This Section 6.2 states Fortra's entire liability and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for infringement and misappropriation claims and actions.

7.   Services.
       7.1   If Customer purchased a perpetual license of the Software and paid its annual Maintenance Fees, Customer shall receive Maintenance Services for the duration of each Maintenance Period.  If Customer purchased a subscription license and paid its annual Subscription Fees, Customer shall receive Maintenance Services as part of its subscription license for the duration of each Subscription Period.  The initial Subscription Period or Maintenance Period shall commence and expire on the dates indicated on the Invoice. Thereafter, the Subscription Period or Maintenance Period renews for successive twelve (12) month periods unless Customer provides written notice of its election to cancel the Maintenance Services at least sixty (60) days in advance of the renewal date or Customer fails to pay its annual Subscription Fees or Maintenance Fees. Within the sixty (60) day period prior to the expiration of the current Subscription Period or Maintenance Period, Fortra shall send Customer an Invoice for the next Subscription Period or Maintenance Period.  Customer's payment of the Subscription Fees or Maintenance Fees in response to an Invoice prior to the expiration date of the then-current Subscription Period or Maintenance Period will extend the Maintenance Services until the new expiration date indicated on the Invoice.  For subscription licenses, if Customer fails to pay the Subscription Fees prior to the expiration date of the then-current Subscription Period, Fortra shall suspend Customer's use of the subscription license and the accompanying Maintenance Services of the Software.  Customer may reinstate the subscription license and accompanying Maintenance Services by paying a relicensing fee to be determined in Fortra's sole discretion.  For perpetual licenses, if Customer fails to pay the Maintenance Fees prior to the expiration date of the then-current Maintenance Period, Customer shall continue to be permitted to utilize the version of the Software for which it last paid the Maintenance Fees, but Fortra shall have the right to suspend Maintenance Services to Customer.  Fortra may condition any subsequent reinstatement of the Maintenance Services on payment of the back unpaid Maintenance Fees from the date that such Maintenance Services stopped through the then-current date and/or a relicensing fee to be determined in Fortra's sole discretion.  With Customer's express authorization and for its convenience, the Parties may mutually agree to allow Fortra to charge the annual Subscription Fees or Maintenance Fees to Customer's credit card via a PCI compliant third-party system upon each renewal date.  Subscription Fees for each Subscription Period or Maintenance Fees for each Maintenance Period are subject to change in Fortra's sole discretion.  All Subscription Fees or Maintenance Fees are non-refundable.  
       7.2   The Maintenance Services specifically and expressly do not include any Professional Services. Professional Services are subject to separate Professional Services Fees to be agreed in a Statement of Work executed by the Parties.

8.   Prices and Payment.
       8.1   Customer shall pay all Fees as set forth in the relevant Invoice.  All Invoices shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the Invoice date.  Fortra may impose late charges on overdue payments at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate legally permitted by law, calculated from the date payment was due until the date payment is made, and all reasonable expenses incurred in collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees.  If Customer in good faith disputes all or a portion of an Invoice, then Customer shall inform Fortra within fifteen (15) days following Customer's receipt of the applicable Invoice.  Following Fortra's receipt of Customer's written dispute, the Parties shall work together, in good faith and acting reasonably, to resolve said dispute.  Promptly following resolution of such dispute, Customer shall pay any amounts determined to be owing as a result of the dispute's resolution.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall be responsible for promptly paying that portion of the Invoice not in dispute.  
       8.2   Customer shall be liable for payment of, and all Fees are exclusive of, all local, state, and federal sales, use and excise or other similar taxes (including withholding taxes) and custom duties that are levied upon and related to the performance of obligations and exercise of rights under this Agreement.  Fortra may be required to collect and remit such taxes from Customer, unless Customer provides Fortra with a valid tax exemption certificate.  Fortra will invoice Customer for all such taxes based on the Software and/or Services provided.  In no event will either Party be liable for any taxes levied against the other Party's net income.

9.   Warranties.
       9.1   Fortra warrants, for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery of the Software (the "Software Warranty Period"), that the Software shall substantially conform to the Software Documentation.  In the event of any breach of the warranty during the Software Warranty Period as set forth in this Section 9.1, Fortra shall correct or replace, at no additional charge to Customer, any portion of the Software found to be defective; provided, however, that if Fortra cannot correct or replace the defective Software within a commercially reasonable time period, then Customer's sole and exclusive remedy shall be to receive a refund of the applicable License Fee paid to Fortra.  Fortra does not warrant that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free or that the Software will meet the Customer's operational requirements. Fortra is not responsible for errors or defects in the Software caused by Customer's failure to comply with the requirements specified in the Software Documentation or changes in or to the operating characteristics of the Customer's computer hardware or operating systems made after delivery of the Software or errors or defects in the Software caused by the interaction of the Software with any third party programs or applications.
